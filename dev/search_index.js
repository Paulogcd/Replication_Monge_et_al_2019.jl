Overall, we were unable to precisely replicate the findings of the paper. We suspect that this is largely driven by the fact that the replication files provided by the authors only detail how to compute the by-country output share of natural resources (MSS_Nrshares.dta). However, no code or further information is provided on how to obtain the tables and figures presented in the paper, which we attempted to replicate based on our understanding of their methodology. Hence, if the authors made further asumptions or undertook additional data-cleaning before plotting, this could explain the discrepancy between our results and theirs.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Figure-1","page":"Home","title":"Figure 1","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"We calculate the number of workers as pop*labsh, then we calculate GDP per worker as cdgdpo divided by this number. The result is close to what is shown in the paper. However, we encounter issues when using the fit function to compute the trendline, possibly drive by a lack of variation due to the large values of GDP and the small values of output shares. The authors do not mention any normalization, so we choose to not make any further modifications to the data.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Figure-2","page":"Home","title":"Figure 2","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"We calculate GDP quartiles using Juliaâ€™s quartile function.

While we can calculate the natural resource share using Equation (13), the methodology to compute their estimates of natural resource shares of output is not available in the replication material. Hence, we restrict ourselves to the estimates provided by the authors and finnd similar results.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Figure-4-and-Table-3","page":"Home","title":"Figure 4 and Table 3","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"QMPK and VMPK are computed following the formulae outlines in sections II and III of the paper. While our estimates are close, we observe minor discrepancies in percentile ranges. Since we cannot verify our computation of MPKs, if the authors undertook further data-cleaning or any additional steps not outlined in the paper, this would explain the divergence in our estimates. They remain, however, reasonably close.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Tables-4-and-5","page":"Home","title":"Tables 4 and 5","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"It is not possible to reconstruct these tables from the replication files and none of the datasets provided by the authors include Sachs and Wernerâ€™s (1995) openness indicator. To attempt the replication nonetheless, we used the SW we could find (available here: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/depts/Economics/Growth/sachs.htm), which is called open.csv in our output folder. We find that the number of obervations does not match the ones reported by the authors, so this is likely not the same data they used. Hence, our results will naturally be different.","category":"page"}]
